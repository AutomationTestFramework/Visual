*   The program in Java that compares any 2 images and shows the differences visually by drawing rectangles.*

*   Pixels (with the same coordinates in two images) can be visually similar, but have
    different values of RGB. We are only consider 2 pixels to be "different" if the
    difference between them is more than 10%.

    differences outlined with red rectangles as shown below a list of difference in the text.
